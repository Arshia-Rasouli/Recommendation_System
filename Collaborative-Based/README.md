# Collaborative Filtering Movie Recommender System

This project implements a **User-Based Collaborative Filtering Movie Recommender System**. This system generates personalized movie recommendations by finding users with similar taste patterns and using their combined ratings.

## About Collaborative Filtering

Collaborative Filtering is a powerful technique that makes predictions about user preferences by collecting preferences or taste information from many users. In a user-based approach, it identifies a "neighborhood" of users who are similar(pearson correlation) to a target user based on their past ratings. Recommendations are then generated by suggesting movies that these similar users liked but the target user has not yet seen. This method relies purely on user interaction data, not on the content of the items themselves.


## Key Steps Involved

* **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Loading datasets and cleaning movie titles.
* **Data Preparation & Matrix Construction**: preprocessing, and merging movie and rating datasets to form a user similarity matrix.
* **Similar User Identification & Ranking**: Finding users with overlapping ratings, calculating their similarity, and ranking the most similar users.
* **Weighted Rating Prediction**: Calculating weighted ratings from similar users and aggregating them to predict scores for unrated movies.
* **Top Recommendations Display**: Presenting the final list of movies recommended to the target user based on predicted scores.
