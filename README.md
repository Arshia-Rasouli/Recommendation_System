# Movie Recommender Systems Project

This project hosts two distinct movie recommender systems: a **Content-Based Recommender** and a **Collaborative Filtering Recommender**. The project aims to demonstrate different approaches to personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences and movie attributes.

## Datasets

The project utilizes standard movie datasets, `movies.csv` and `ratings.csv`. These datasets are located in the `data/` directory and are shared by both recommender systems.

* `movies-data.csv`: Contains movie metadata such as `movieId`, `title`, and `genres`.
* `ratings-data.csv`: Contains user ratings, including `userId`, `movieId`, `rating`, and `timestamp`.
